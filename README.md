Testing Methodology:

Unit Testing: Test individual functions and components in isolation to ensure they work correctly. (Tools: Jest, Enzyme, React Testing Library)
Integration Testing: Test the interaction between different components and modules.
End-to-End (E2E) Testing: Test complete user flows to ensure the system works as expected from the user's perspective. (Tools: Cypress, Selenium)
This detailed testing plan covers the core functionality of the Hackzter MVP. As you add more features and complexity, you will need to expand your test cases accordingly.

Remember to prioritize testing throughout the development process. Itâ€™s much easier and more efficient to identify and fix bugs early on than after the platform has been launched!

## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

We don't support custom domains (yet). If you want to deploy your project under your own domain, then we recommend GitHub Pages.

To use GitHub Pages you will need to follow these steps: 
- Deploy your project using GitHub Pages - instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site)
- Configure a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site - instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
